# Minisearch

Updates:

  1. Deleted Bing, i think it dosnt have a purpose, with Google
  having the overall best search engine and DuckDuckGo having an anonymous one.
  2. Changed appareance, i like these colors more      
  3. overall deleted unnecessary code making Minisearch not only look       
  minimalistic but also have a minimal code without bloat:                                 Mingo(base used to make Minisearch):      107 lines / 3.19Kb                             Minisearch(my fork of Mingo):             31 lines/ 1.73Kb

A minimalistic site to search with Google or DuckDuckGo engines, make it your homepage and/or bookmark it if you want :P.
Also because of how short and easy to understand the code is you can consider Minisearch just a base to build your own custom start page, if somone looks at the code and finds something that could be more efficient/less bloated, please tell me i always welcome learning new ways to code.
