# Minisearch

Update:
        1. Deleted Bing, i think it dosnt have a purpose, while Google having the                  overall best search engine and DuckDuckGo having an anonymous one.

        2. Changed appareance, i like these colors more
            
        3. overall deleted unnecessary code making Minisearch not only look       
           minimalistic but also have a minimal code whitout bloat.
            
A minimalistic HTML file to search Google or DuckDuckGo.
