# Minisearch

Updates:
        1. Deleted Bing, i think it dosnt have a purpose, while Google having the                  overall best search engine and DuckDuckGo having an anonymous one.

        2. Changed appareance, i like these colors more
            
        3. overall deleted unnecessary code making Minisearch not only look       
           minimalistic but also have a minimal code whitout bloat:
           Mingo: 107 lines / 3.19Kb
           Minisearch: 31 lines/ 1.73Kb
            
A minimalistic HTML file to search Google or DuckDuckGo.
