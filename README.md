# Minisearch

Updates:

  1. Deleted Bing, i think it dosnt have a purpose, with Google
  having the overall best search engine and DuckDuckGo having an anonymous one.  
  2. Changed appareance, i like these colors more  
  3. overall deleted unnecessary code making Minisearch not only look  
  minimalistic but also have a minimal code without bloat:  
  Mingo(base used to make Minisearch):      107 lines / 3.19Kb  
  Minisearch(my fork of Mingo):             30 lines/ 1.7Kb
